1. Wait for the Gradle sync to finish.<BR>
1. Add the Realm App ID from your template to `local.properties`:<BR>
`realm_app_id=your_app_id`<BR>

To be able to login to the app once it is built, you need to create a user in your instance of the [O-FISH Realm App](https://github.com/WildAid/o-fish-realm) or [in the sandbox environment](https://bit.ly/ofishsandbox).
